# Simon-Game

I am delighted to share that this code has increased my knowledge of how to use arrays effectively to store and manipulate data. Through this project, I have gained a better understanding of creating functions and using jQuery to manipulate HTML elements on a webpage. Specifically, I was able to create a sequence of game patterns, generate random numbers, and compare user input with the game pattern.

Moreover, I have implemented sounds and animation to make the game more interactive and engaging for the users. I have also learned how to restart the game when necessary, which is an essential skill to have as a web developer.

As I worked on this project, I became more comfortable using conditional statements such as "if" statements to control the program's flow. For instance, I used an "if" statement to ensure that the game had started before allowing the user to begin playing.

Overall, this code has provided me with a solid foundation in basic web development techniques and programming concepts. I am excited to continue honing my skills and applying what I have learned to future projects.
